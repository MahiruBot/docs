# Profile section

View your statistics including amount of commands/buttons/inline commands used for all time and your usage of the bot in past 7 days. The delay in updating data may be up to 10 minutes. 

## How and what we collect

Mahiru collects data every time you use command/button/inline command and uploads it to the server after a certain period of time. The only purpose of this is to show you the statistics and display general info about usage of Mahiru on our [website](https://mahiru.one).

**The data we collect includes:**

- Your Telegram ID.
- Time when the action was performed.
- Name of the action (command name, button name).
- Type of the action (command/button/inline command).

We do not collect any personal info like arguments you pass or buttons' callback data. You are the only one who can view this info.

## Clearing your statistics

You may want to clear all your statistics that Mahiru has collected. To do this, open your dashboard, navigate to **«Profile»**, click **«:octicons-kebab-horizontal-24:»** in the right top corner and tap on **«Clear all Data»**. This will permanently delete all statistical data about you in Mahiru's database.
