# Introduction

Mahiru provides you with a convenient and feature-rich web dashboard which you can use directly inside the Telegram app. It allows you to easily customize your experience with Mahiru, connect game accounts, view your statistics etc.

## How to open your dashboard

In order to view your dashboard, go to your chat with Mahiru in Telegram app, then and click on **«Dashboard»** button near your input field. If this button is not present or you get any errors when launching it, try restarting the bot. If restart did not help, let us know in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/MahiruCommunity).

## Bugs during Dashboard usage

Bugs inside a dashboard are extremely hard to track. That's why if you have encouraged anything that seems not right for you during dashboard usage, please report it to our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/MahiruCommunity) as soon as possible.

## Your data security

???+ Warning "Warning"

    There is a way to use dashboard outside Telegram clients during Beta. This feature
    is enabled for debugging purposes and that is why you must not ever share your authkey
    to anyone. We will never ask you for it under no circumstances.

In production, dashboard is completely safe to use since it uses encrypted data provided by Telegram in order to verify users. There is no way to open dashboard in browser because authentication is not possible outside Telegram clients.
