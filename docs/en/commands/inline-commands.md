# Inline commands

You can use inline commands in any chat by typing `@MahiruShiinaBot command: arguments` in the text field. Not all commands have inline versions because of Telegram limitations.

## Limitations

There are some restrictions applied to inline commands, for example, you can not upload files in `imgtotext` command or use `conversation: true` in `gpt` command. 

In the table below you can see all nuances for all commands.
