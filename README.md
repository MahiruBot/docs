### Adding a localization

In case you want to add a new localization, copy `en` folder in the `/docs` and name it according to the [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). Then localize every file and don't forget to update configuration in `mkdocs.yml` as well.

Here is a list of localizations Mahiru may need:
